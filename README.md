### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm Zendyn Reddy, a developer and designer from South Africa.  
I like turning ideas into small, polished products – from web apps to creative tools.

Right now I'm:

- Studying **BSc Computer Science** (University of London – distance learning)
- Building and experimenting under **ZoneBroz Studios**
- Learning in public and slowly growing my projects into real products

---

### 🔧 Tech Stack

I work mostly with:

`TypeScript` · `JavaScript` · `React` · `Vite` · `Tailwind CSS`  
`Firebase / Firestore` · `PostgreSQL` · `Node.js`  
Plus some `C++` and lower-level stuff when I feel like suffering a bit 😄

### 🚀 Things I'm Building

- **FurlyFuzz / PetApp** – A pet-care app with tracking, health logs and cute, comfy UI.
- **DreamDelusion** – A “thought catcher” that lets you speak your ideas and saves the transcript.
- **ZoneBroz Studios** – My umbrella brand for web apps, tools and experiments.

I love mixing:

- Clean, modern UI design  
- Useful, everyday functionality  
- Small details that make apps feel fun and alive
